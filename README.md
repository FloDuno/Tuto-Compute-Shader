# Tutorial with source code about compute shaders in Unity

A compute shader is a shader that doesn't necessarily outputs a pixel but any kind of data. This README is here to list all tutorials found on other websites.

* The Unity [manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ComputeShaders.html) about it 
* The Unity [API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ComputeShader.html)
* The [msdn doc](https://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/windows/desktop/ff476331(v=vs.85).aspx)
* A tutorial for advanced shader user by [Kyle Halladay](http://kylehalladay.com/blog/tutorial/2014/06/27/Compute-Shaders-Are-Nifty.html)
* An other by [Emerson Shaffer](http://www.emersonshaffer.com/blog/2016/5/11/unity3d-compute-shader-introduction-tutorial)
* The best introduction for me by [Cheney Shen](http://cheneyshen.com/directcompute-tutorial-for-unity-kernels-and-thread-groups/)
* All other [Cheney Shen](http://cheneyshen.com/?s=compute&Submit=SEARCH) tutorials about it
* How to optimize thread groups number by [gpuopen](http://gpuopen.com/optimizing-gpu-occupancy-resource-usage-large-thread-groups/)
* NVidia [presentation](http://www.nvidia.com/content/GTC-2010/pdfs/2260_GTC2010.pdf) about optimization in compute shaders 
* A forum [thread](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/684530-compute-threads/) also about optimization

Feel free to ask me thing via the issue tab if you don't understand something or if there are mistakes in the repo :)



Happy coding !
